Boltek StormTracker to StormForce Driver (st2sf)
================================================

*** Currently only Linux is supported until the driver is ported to other operating systems ***


First install the driver using the code from the SDK: -

# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install linux-headers libc6-dev
# cd boltek-sdk/driver
# make
# mkdir /etc/boltek
# cp boltek.ko /etc/boltek/boltek.ko
# cp 77-boltek.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
# vi /etc/rc.local (add "insmod boltek.ko" without the quotes before the "exit 0" line)

Test it: -

# insmod /etc/boltek/boltek.ko
# dmesg

You should see a line similar to "Boltek Lightning Detector started at /dev/lightning-0 major 252 minor 0".  If not something hasn't worked - start again.


Now we're ready to build the wrapper program: -

# cd st2sf
# make

You should now have a executable called "st2sf", before running StormForce run this program like this: -

# ./st2sf 0 12345

This will start the wrapper program setting the StormTracker's squelch level to 0 and using port TCP/12345 for StormForce to connect to.  The wrapper won't start sending sentences until it gets a connection from StormForce.

Section of XML settings file for StormForce to use the wrapper will be: -

	<Setting StormTrackerPort="tcp://localhost:12345"/>
	<Setting StormTrackerPortCompression=""/>
	<Setting StormTrackerPortType="TEXT"/>
	<Setting StormTrackerSkewAmount="0.0"/>
	<Setting StormTrackerSquelchLevel="0"/>

Please note that the squelch level in the XML is currently ignored since it's defined by the wrapper.

You could also have the wrapper sat on it's own box - just change the hostname and port!  Don't forget to tweak the firewall to allow the connection!

That's it, just startup StormForce and enjoy your StormTracker under Linux, sorted!
